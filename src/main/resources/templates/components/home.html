        Crew has been updated to version 2.7. Read all about it in the <a href="/releasenotes">release notes</a>.
      </p>

      <p><a th:href="@{/store}"><i class="bi bi-shop-window h3 color-store"></i></a></p>

      <p>The store is where you can place orderRequest for equipment and supplies for your campus.
        Each item you request will be forwarded to the appropriate person to provide you with the things
        you need efficiently.
      </p>

      <p>Second, is Resources.</p>
      <p><a th:href="@{/resource}"><i class="bi bi-file-text h3 color-wiki"></i></a></p>

      <p>Here you can read up on the latest information to help you in your ministry.
        You can post articles for your team and get general help without needing to track down the best resource on your own.
        There will also be training materials along with Destiny approved operational guides.
      </p>

      <p>Last, we have Support.</p>
      <p><a th:href="@{/support}"><i class="bi bi-life-preserver h3 color-support"></i></a></p>

      <p>We issues arise at your campus, the best way to get help is to submit a ticket. This ensures that everyone who
        needs to know, does know. You can also keep up-to-date on the progress of your tickets and provide additional information
        as symptoms progress. Tickets also help give pastors and team leaders an indication of the technical health of each campus.
